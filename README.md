## Hi, I'm Paul.
## A scientist and software engineer.
### My passions are food, ecology, and technology. Currently, I'm excited about building AI tools and products for sustainable farming.

## About Me
I've spent the past 8 years in school getting a B.S. in Biology and a Ph.D. in Entomology (study of bugs). My goal for my academic research is to design farm management programs that helps farmers have healthier land, with higher profits, and lower reliance on external inputs. **Click here to check out my research.*8

Now a days, I spend a portion of my time working on software. I began teaching myself to code 3+ years ago and consider myself to be a full-stack software developer. It's amazing what you can do do with a computer and internet connection. **Click here to check out some of my projects*
